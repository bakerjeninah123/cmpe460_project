#  Detect Stacked Carton

This project aims to detect stacked cartons using a dataset from the link https://app.roboflow.com/ds/ZCwOYJLruw?key=SjV4l9bmj5 <br /> 
and the YOLO v7 model was used for this project. <br /> 
The code for the project can be found on Google Colab at the link https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16mSdknept21AFzi-2oNY6hCVFMLtqGcJ?usp=sharing 
and more information about the YOLO v7 model can be found at the link https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7.
Additionally, there are two videos provided to demonstrate the model's ability to detect stacked cartons in real-world scenarios, which can be viewed at the links 
https://youtu.be/-Q5Bn0KSe4A and https://youtu.be/9gmXKGZR9jY.

The dataset used in this project was obtained from the paper available at the reference link https://github.com/yancie-yjr/scd.github.io
